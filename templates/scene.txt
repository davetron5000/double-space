It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents — except at
occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
swept up the streets (for it is in *London* that our scene lies),
rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame
of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

Through one of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little
loved by the gentlemen of the police, a man evidently of the lowest orders
was wending his solitary way.
